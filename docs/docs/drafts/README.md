# Drafts

> Prototypes (not implemented)

 - [Spec Draft 1](spec-draft-1.md): an early variant
 - [Spec Draft 2](spec-draft-2.md): I liked this one the best, but the flexibility made implementation in Go impossible (serializing recursive structs into Go that could be two different types).
 - [Spec Draft 3](spec-draft-3.md): better, but flawed in that requirements were separate from schedulable units of work, and more specifically, slots within them.
